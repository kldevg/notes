## Know the version and build

Run in PowerShell:
```powershell
# Displays the version in a window 
winver

# Displays the version in the terminal
systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"OS Name" /C:"OS Version"
```

## Know the domain

Run in PowerShell either of the two:
```powershell
systeminfo | findstr /B /C:"Domain"
wmic computersystem get domain
```

## Know whether a service is running on a port number

Run in PowerShell:
```powershell
netstat -an -b | grep <port_number>
```

## Create a EXT4 partition

Run in PowerShell:
```powershell

## Wipe all the deleted data / free space on a drive

1. creates a first file in that folder filled with `0`, making it grow until the hard drive fills up

1. deletes that file and creates a second one filled with `255`, making it grow until the hard drive fills up

1. deletes the second file, creates a third file filled with random numbers, making it grow until the hard drive fills up again

1. deletes the third file and returns you to the prompt
